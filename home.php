As you know, we’ve just reopened after the pandemic-related shutdown, so — out of an abundance of caution — we’ve made a few changes. Safety is our top priority!
<BR>
First off, thank you for letting us take your temperature. Yours is 98.4 degrees, which is great. Now we’ll unseal the dining-room doors for you.
<br>
May I say that those are lovely sweatpants that you’re wearing?
<br>
Here is your table. We haven’t set it yet because we want you to know that everything has been completely sanitized before your arrival. We’ll bring a fresh baggie of plastic utensils shortly. Just like at an airport! Remember those? They were fun.
<br>
The smell? Please don’t think of it as “bleach.” We prefer to think of it as the subtle-yet-distinct aroma of safety.
<br>
Oh, hahaha! No, those aren’t people at the next table. They’re mannequins that we’ve placed in empty seats to make the room look fuller during this ongoing period of mandated 50 percent capacity. We know that the idea of proximity to other humans is still a bit scary, so our manager filled the room with dead-eyed, fake humans instead. You know, for comfort!
<br>
We no longer offer a physical menu. Instead, we put it online so you can read it on your personal device. Sure, it used to be “rude” to look at your phone during dinner, but those days are long gone! It was fun to have the freedom to care about such trivial things, wasn’t it?
<br>
We want you to be as comfortable as possible during your visit.
